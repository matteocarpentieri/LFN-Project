# LFN-Project

## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for the Learning from Networks project, focused on accident severity prediction near major intersections in London using machine learning techniques and graph neural networks.

## Team Members

| Last Name | First Name | Role and Contributions                                           |
|-----------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Carpentieri | Matteo    | Developed SVM, KNN, and Random Forest models. Created the dataset for training machine learning models. Generated the London graph and utilized features from OSM |
| Varini      | Alberto    | Developed the Graph Neural Network part. Refactored code and fixed code blocks. Explored and implemented solutions for dataset creation                         |
| Taormina    | Gabriel    | Developed some SVM models.  Made improvements to the Graph Neural Network. Checked and adjusted dataset completeness. Wrote parts of the report and managed final code    |

## Instructions

To run and test the project code, follow the steps below:

1. Download the [UK_accidents dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/devansodariya/road-accident-united-kingdom-uk-dataset?resource=download)
2. Open the [Google Colab Jupyter Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1fH-3HqpZPK7ojD0heBuxsMn5orCYjSTl?usp=sharing) and upload the downloaded dataset.
3. Execute all the cells as explained in the notebook.
